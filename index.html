        <h1>About Mmasechaba Justicia Francesca ðŸ˜Š:</h1>
        <p>
            I am an experienced Project Coordinator with a demonstrated history 
            of working in the information technology and services industry. 
            Skilled in SolidWorks, Asset Management, Team Building and Blogging. 
            I am currently in my fourth year at the University of Cape Town studying towards 
            a BSc in Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering. I would describe myself as a sea 
            trapped inside a water droplet because I have a vast array of experience outside of 
            my university career. I am also interested in the medical field (disability and 
            rehabilitation studies) and I am not only focused on the information and technology sector.
